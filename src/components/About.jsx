          From automating manual coil winding processes to designing 3D robotics
          systems and delving into the complexities of fuzzy sliding mode
          control, my journey reflects a relentless pursuit of innovation in
          engineering. Now, as a Ph.D. researcher, I'm focused on interpretable
          AI for healthcare, aiming to revolutionize diagnostics and treatment
          strategies. With projects spanning OCR for Geâ€™ez language and beyond,
          my passion lies in bridging cutting-edge technology with real-world
          challenges to make impactful contributions at the intersection of
          technology and humanity.
